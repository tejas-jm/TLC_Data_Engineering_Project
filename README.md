# TLC_Data_Engineering_Project
An end-to-end data engineering project leveraging MAGE for transformation, GCP's BigQuery for storage, and Looker for insightful visualization using Uber trip data."

## Project Overview
This project covers the end-to-end process of working with Uber trip data, including:
- Extracting raw data from CSV files.
- Transforming the data into structured dimension and fact tables via Mage.
- Loading the transformed data into Google BigQuery for efficient querying.
- Creating insightful visualizations using tools like Google Data Studio.
